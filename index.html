          This project will be a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills and experiences as a developer. It will feature a clean and modern design, and include information about my education, work history, and technical abilities. The website will be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is intended to be a living document, with regular updates as I continue to learn and grow in my career.
